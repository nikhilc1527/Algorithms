I have a whole repository for this: [Graph Theory](https://github.com/nishantc1527/Graph-Theory)

A Graph is a kind of data structure that can be described as a mess of nodes somehow connected with each other. Sometimes, the connections can have a certain cost,
or weight. Graphs are really useful in the real world. For example, Google Map has lot's of houses, which can be nodes, and roads as the connections, or often
called edges. When you pick a starting and ending point, Google Maps has to quickly calculate the shortest path from the source node to the target node. This also
includes the weights of the roads, which can be the length of the road and traffic. There are many different algorithms in graphs. A directed graph is an example of
a kind of graph. In a directed graph, each edge has only one direction. In the Google Maps example, there can be one-way roads. There are other kinds, like weighted
graphs, where each edge has a certain weight, and bidirectional graphs, where each edge goes both ways.
