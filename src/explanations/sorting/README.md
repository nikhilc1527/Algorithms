Sorting algorithms are algorithms where, given an array, it sorts the elements in the array in sorted order. For example, this array:

0 3 3 6 2 5 3 8 5 8

is currently not sorted. After sorting, the array becomes this:

0 2 3 3 3 5 5 6 8 8

There are a variety of sorting algorithms. The slowest kind are quadratic sorting algorithms, which can sort in a time complexity of O(N ^ 2). Then comes
the sorting algorithms that sorts in O(N log N) (N times log N). And finally, there are a bunch of sorting algorithms that sort almost in linear times.
Such time complexities include O(N + K) or O(D (N + B)). I will talk about what those letters mean in those algorithms.
