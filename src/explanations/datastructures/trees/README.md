Trees are a broad term for tons of different data structure. You can think of them like a linked list, except every node has more than one child. If you try to
visualize it, it looks like a tree (except upside-down, because the computer scientists never studies nature). Here is an example of what it can look like:

           5
          / \
         /   \
        4     6
       /|\     \
      / | \     7
     7  8  9
     
Tree nodes are referred to as family terms. For example, the node pointing to a node is the parent of that node. Each node has a left and right child.
Your parents other child is your sibling, and so on. There are also some tree terms. The top most node in the tree is the root, and a node that has no children is called a leaf.  

There are many applications for trees. Most of the time, they are used to achieve really fast running
times like O(lg N) most commonly.
