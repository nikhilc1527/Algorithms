A Min Priority Queue is a form of a data structure that can easily find the smallest element added so far, remove the smallest element, and decrease the value
of an element. Of course, there are also Max Priority Queues, but those aren't as used. An easy way to implement it is to search for the smallest element every
time, but that isn't as efficient as some of the other implementations.
