Depth First Search is a common searching method. Depth first search is where you first print the vertex your on, then print the neighbors, like breadth first
search. But unlike breadth first search, when it sees a neighbor, it search all of it's neighbors before continuing on to the other neighbors. For example, if
you take this graph:

"a -> b -> c
"↓  ↖
"e -> d"

and the start is 'a', then you first print 'a'. Then, you find it's neighbors, 'b' and 'e'. You first print 'b', but then you look at all of it's neighbors.
'b''s neighbor is 'c', so you print that, but you see it has no neighbors, so you return. You do the same for 'e'.
