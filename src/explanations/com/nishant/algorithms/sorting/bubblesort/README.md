Bubble Sort is a quadratic sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts in O(N ^ 2). The algorithm works as follows: It first scans the array, and at each element, it checks
if the element after that is smaller than it. This signifies that they are out of order, because in a sorted array, it's not possible for a larger number to be followed
by a smaller number. So, it swaps the two numbers, making a smaller number followed by a larger number. After iterating through the array once, the array is a little more
sorted than before. Furthermore, every iteration the largest number goes to the end, or bubbles to the end, hence the name bubble sort. If every iteration the largest number
arrives at the end, if you repeat this process multiple times, the array will eventually be sorted. How many times? N times, because all N numbers will go to their correct position.
