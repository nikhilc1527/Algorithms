NOTE: Please ***do not*** think this is an efficient algorithm. I added this as a joke.

Bogo sort, the fastest algorithm of all, can sort an algorithm with the worst case time of O(infinity). How it works is it randomly shuffles the array, then checks if
it is sorted. If not, it continues. It does this until the array is sorted.
