Problem: Given an array that only contains duplicates except for one number, which only shows up once, return the number that appears only once. Solve in O(N) and
using bit manipulation.

Example:

Input(1, 2, 2, 1, 5)
Output(5)

Solution: Using the property that a ^ b ^ a = b, we can extend that to a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c = c. Since XOR is commutative, a, b, and c can appear anywhere. So we can
keep a xor variable, and set it to the XOR of every element in the array. The resulting number will be the answer.
