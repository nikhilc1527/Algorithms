A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that can insert, delete, and search all in O(lg N). First, a binary search tree is defined by a node called the root of the
tree, and each node stores it's value, and it's left and right node. Those left and right node stores it's left and right node, and so on until nodes left and right
nodes become null, indicating it has no left and right node. An example of a binary tree is this:

                    1
                   / \
                  2   3
                 / \ / \
                4  5 6  7

A binary search tree is a binary tree where every single node on the right is larger than the current node, and every single node on the left is smaller than the
current node. An example of a binary search tree is this:

                    5
                   / \
                  3   7
                 / \ / \
                2  4 6  8

So, you can easily search through a tree by starting at the root node, then check if the
value you are searching for is larger than the root. If it is, you move right, else move left. You repeat this process with the next node until you find the value.
The exact amount of steps you take to get to your node is lg N. This process, if you noticed, is similar to binary search.

Vocabulary: Tree nodes are referred to as family terms. For example, the node pointing to a node is the parent of that node. Each node has a left and right child.
Your parents other child is your sibling, and so on. The top most node in the tree is the root, and a node that has no children is called a leaf.
