# Python Users

Python is supported, and testing is all done in pytest. You probably won't need to install it, but if you run into problems, use this
command:

    pip install -U pytest
    
# Running Files

Running files is extremely easy. Just use this command:

    python <path-to-file>
    
And it runs. To run a test, put the ```-u``` option before ```<path-to-file>```.
